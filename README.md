# cunty-scrobbler âœ¨ðŸ’…

serving pure cunt for your last.fm needs since today. period.

## it eats, it slays, it scrobbles ðŸ’‹

- scrobble tracks like the bad bitch you are
- serve entire albums in one go
- batch that shit because who has time?
- hot pink aesthetic that will make the girls gag
- no messy .env files because we're not basic

## how to get this shit on your computer

1. grab the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/jafarnz/swyft/releases)
2. extract wherever tf you want
3. double click and get your life
4. mac girlies: the app now ships as a notarization-friendly `.app` bundle. unzip and drag it wherever (~/Applications works). credentials live in your user config (`~/Library/Application Support/cunty-scrobbler/config.json`), so no more files cluttering the app folder.

3. launch the app
4. put your credentials in
5. start serving tracks
